//! `release check-pkg-signature <pkg> --identity <name>`: refuses the installer pkg unless macOS

//! of the pkg (through [`BuildPkg::check_signature`], which fails when `pkgutil` exits other than
//! 0) and refuses it, naming every reason, unless:
//!
//! 1. its `Status:` is one of [`TRUSTED_STATUSES`], the words `pkgutil` uses for a signature whose
//!    chain the Mac trusts (they differ between macOS versions);
//! 2. it was signed with a trusted timestamp (the release signs with `productsign --timestamp`, so
//!    the signature stays valid after the certificate expires);
//! 3. its certificate chain is exactly the identity, then [`INTERMEDIATE`], then [`ROOT`]:
//!    the Developer ID Installer identity, Apple's Developer ID intermediate and Apple's root.
//!
//! The identity must be a Developer ID Installer identity ([`IDENTITY_PREFIX`]); any other is
//! refused before `pkgutil` runs.
